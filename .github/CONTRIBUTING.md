# Contributing to ESLint Plugin Pretty Import

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This plugin is pretty opinionated
about how imports should look, but there's always room for improvement in
implementation, performance, and reliability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Bun** v1.0+ (I use Bun for package management and testing)
- **ESLint** v8+ (v9 preferred)

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kamiya4047/eslint-plugin-pretty-import.git
cd eslint-plugin-pretty-import

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run tests
bun test

# Build the plugin
bun run build

# Test with the example project
cd example
bun install
bunx eslint test.js --fix
```

└── rules/              # Individual rule docs
```

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Watch mode for development
bun test:watch

# Test a specific file
bun test test/rules/sort-import-groups.test.ts
```

### Testing Changes

The `example/` directory contains sample files to test your changes:

```bash
cd example
bunx eslint test.js --fix  # Test the plugin
```

You can also create additional test files in `example/` to verify specific
scenarios.

### Building

```bash
# Build for distribution
bun run build

# Development mode (rebuilds on changes)
bun run dev
```

## Writing Tests

We use Bun's built-in test runner. Rule tests should follow this pattern:

```typescript
import { RuleTester } from "@typescript-eslint/utils/testing";
import rule from "@/rules/my-rule";

import parser from '@typescript-eslint/parser';

const ruleTester = new RuleTester({
  languageOptions: {
    parser,
    parserOptions: {
      ecmaVersion: 2022,
      sourceType: 'module',
      projectService: true,
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
});

ruleTester.run("rule", rule, {
  valid: [
    {
      code: `import { a } from 'valid';`,
    },
  ],
  invalid: [
    {
      code: `import { b, a } from 'invalid';`,
      errors: [{ messageId: "sortAlphabetically" }],
      output: `import { a, b } from 'invalid';`,
    },
  ],
});
```

## What We're Looking For

### Good Contributions

- **Bug fixes** - Especially edge cases in sorting logic
- **Performance improvements** - Import parsing can be expensive
- **Test coverage** - More test cases, especially edge cases
- **Documentation improvements** - Clearer examples, better explanations
- **TypeScript improvements** - Better type safety, inference
- **Compatibility** - Support for more ESLint versions, Node versions

### Things We're Not Looking For

- **Changes to the sorting philosophy** - The opinionated behavior is
  intentional
- **New rules** - This plugin is focused on import sorting specifically
- **Major API changes** - Keep it simple and focused

## Coding Standards

- **TypeScript** - All code should be properly typed
- **ESLint** - Follow our ESLint configuration
- **Naming** - Use clear, descriptive function and variable names
- **Comments** - Explain complex sorting logic, but don't over-comment

### Code Style

```typescript
// Good: Clear function names and types
function sortByImportCount(imports: ImportGroup[]): ImportGroup[] {
  return imports.sort((a, b) => b.names.length - a.names.length);
}

// Good: Descriptive variable names
const builtinImports = imports.filter(isBuiltinModule);
const thirdPartyImports = imports.filter(isThirdPartyModule);

// Good: Comment complex logic
// River system: preserve side effect execution order by treating
// them as section boundaries that cannot be crossed
function splitByRivers(imports: Import[]): Import[][] {
  // ... implementation
}
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process
